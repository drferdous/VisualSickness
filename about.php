            <p>This project was developed by the VR lab at The College of New Jersey. The goal of this project is twofold:</p>

		<ol>
  		<li>To compare the effectiveness of a visual cybersickness questionnaire with a standard text-based cybersickness questionnaire.</li>
  		<li>To provide the VR research community with a system to organize all the cybersickness data they collect. 
This collection of anonymized data can be used to detect trends or train machine learning models. 
An user manual of our system can be found <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XSZlcbz_8iEzdgiPZ2g8Iyp6gSbLJcntcA8DzL2TqSc" target="_blank">here.</a> </li>

		<p>This project is supported by the National Science Foundation (Award No. 2104819).</p>
